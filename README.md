# PPVviaVLC

PPVviaVLC enables anyone to broadcast pay-per-view (PPV) live streams from the comfort of their own device using VLC. It tokenizes access to your encrypted VLC stream so viewers must purchase a token to watch.

## Features
- Uses standard VLC tools to stream directly from your machine.
- Token-based access allows you to charge per viewer.
- Keeps streams encrypted until a valid token is provided.

## Getting Started
1. Install VLC on your computer.
2. Clone this repository and configure the stream settings.
3. Launch your broadcast using VLC.
4. Share your tokens so viewers can watch the live PPV stream.

Remember to only stream content you have rights to share and comply with all local laws regarding pay-per-view broadcasts.
